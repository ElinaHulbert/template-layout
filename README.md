# Templating. Landing Page for a company with jQuery
##### :muscle: What was my motivation?
It's been a long time I have studied React and JavaScript and sometimes it felt like I need to go back to templating to feel more confident. Therefore I found a free psd template and built it.
##### :books: What did I learn?
Besides how to use semantic HTML and different tags, I tried jQuery for the first time and got to know what Slick Slider is, as well as how to scroll onClick.
##### :flashlight: How to use the project?
There is no much of a use of this project for someone, but you can get inspired! :) It is fully responsive so you can try it out on your mobiles and tablets.
